### About the game:

I created a memory card game using Pokemon cards. A memory card game is one where you have to select two cards, and see if they're a match. You have to remember where the cards are in order to get all of the matches. This is a game I used to play often as a child, but with real cards, not on the internet. I decided to choose a Pokemon theme because it's already something that uses cards. I actually wasn't into Pokemon as a child, but I got into Pokemon GO recently because of my boyfriend. He loves Pokemon.

### Instructions:

1. **Flip Cards**: Click on two cards to flip them over.
2. **Match Pairs**: Find matching pairs of cards.
3. **Try Again**: If cards don't match, they'll flip back over after a short delay.
4. **Win**: Complete all matches within the alloted time to win the game.

### Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript 

### Planned future enhancements:

* Add a hard-mode
* Add an animation when a player makes a match or when they win
* Add audio when the player starts the game or when they make a match
