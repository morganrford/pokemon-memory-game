// Psuedocode

//1 I'll define all of the required variables, leaving any empty as needed. 

//2 I'll store the cached element references using getbyID.

//3 I'll create the initialize game and render functions. 

//4 I'll handle each instead of the player clicking a button using a handleclick function.

//5 I'll create a timer to allow only a certain amount of time for the player to make their choices.

//6 I'll code a way for the player to turn over the cards, which will change the image from the back of the pokemon card with the pokemon logo to the front with pokemon on it.

//7 I'll code a way for the program to recognize when a match has been made.

//8 I'll implement a way for the the player to only keep playing until the timer is up or until they have made too many incorrect matches.

//9 I'll code the message feature so that the player is able to view the current state of the game, such as whether their match was correct or incorrect, to keep going, or if they've lost.

//10 I'll code my reset function so that the player can try again. 

//11 I'll make sure the render and initialize features work. 

//12 I'll make sure everything is running properly and that there are no errors. 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// I need to think about whether every time you reset the game if it will show the same cards or instead, new cards from a set amount of cards.
